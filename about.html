        Greg and his nephew Gabe began working together in 2020. Greg has been acquiring the knowledge and tools to run a professional wood-shop his entire life. When Covid-19 hit, he decided there was no better way to quarantine then by tackling various wood-working projects.  He enlisted the help of his nephew to increase production and spread the word. 
  Our goal is to create beautiful projects that bring people joy through the attention to detail and craftsmanship. We use the highest quality materials available to create pieces that are both beautiful yet functional.  Every piece we make is a one-of-a-kind.
